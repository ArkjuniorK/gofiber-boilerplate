# Modular Monolith Boilerplate

This boilerplate focus on how to design modular monolith structure
that easy to understand, fast to implement and make the boundaries more
clear after each domain with no magic, just a code. So devs didn't have to
open or read the docs/code about how things are works, simply implement
and then devs knows how it's done.

### TODO:

- ~~Implement Swagger Documentation~~
- Add Dockerfile
- Add database migration and seeder
